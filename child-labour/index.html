			<h2>What is child labour?</h2>
			<p class="normal">Child labour is a socio-economic and universal phenomenon. It is the employment of children in an industry or business, especially when the industry or business is considered illegal or exploitative.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="why">
			<h2>Why does child labour happen?</h2>
			<p class="normal">Children work because their survival and that of their families depend on it, and in many cases because unscrupulous adults take advantage of their vulnerability. It is also due to inadequacies and weaknesses in national educational systems. It is deeply ingrained in cultural and social attitudes and traditions.</p>
		</div>
	
		<div id="effects">
		<h2>What are the effects of child labour on human wellbeing?</h2>
			<p class="normal">Child labour deprives children of their childhood, interferes their abilities to be educated and can be physically, emotionally, mentally socially and morally harmful. Children end up doing work that is longer than an appropriate number of hours given the age of the child and/or the type of work, and it deprives their dignity.</p>
			<p class="normal">However, there can be benefits for children who work under the correct conditions, like balancing work with other activities and preparing for work as an adult. </p>
			<p class="normal">The worst forms of child labour involves children being enslaved, separated from their families, exposed to serious hazards and illnesses and/or left to fend for themselves on the streets of large cities â€“ often at a very early age.</p>
			<p class="normal">Millions of them suffer in the other worst forms of child labour, including slavery and slavery-like practices such as forced and bonded labour and child soldiering, sexual exploitation, or are used by adults in illicit activities, including drug trafficking.</p>
